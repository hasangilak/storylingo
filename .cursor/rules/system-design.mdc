# Rule: Senior UI/UX System Design & Vibe

## Purpose
This rule is to be used every time when designing new features or pages. It ensures the design intent, user experience, and visual identity are preserved and enhanced.

## Guidelines
- **Design Intent**: Every page and feature should reflect the app's mission: making language learning engaging through storytelling.
- **Layout**: Use clear, modern layouts with generous spacing. Prioritize readability and intuitive navigation. Mobile-first, responsive design is mandatory.
- **Color & Vibe**: Embrace vibrant gradients (purples, blues, greens), glassmorphism, and soft shadows. The vibe should be modern, inviting, and a bit magical—evoking curiosity and creativity.
- **Typography**: Use playful yet readable fonts. Highlight key actions and titles with bold, gradient text.
- **Imagery**: Use high-quality, story-themed images and avatars. Illustrations should feel lively and support the narrative.
- **Microinteractions**: Add subtle animations (e.g., button ripples, card hover, animated backgrounds) to make the experience delightful.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure color contrast, font size, and interactive elements are accessible to all users.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent spacing, color, and component usage across the app.
- **User Flow**: Design for minimal friction—clear CTAs, progressive disclosure, and helpful feedback.
- **Feedback**: Use toasts, modals, and inline hints to guide users and celebrate achievements.
- **Continuous Design Review**: Regularly review and iterate on design based on user feedback and analytics.
